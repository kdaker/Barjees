# Barjees for iOS

The Middle Eastern game of Barjees is now on iOS for the first time! Barjees is a cross and circle-type game similar to Pachisi, Parcheesi and Ludo. Designed to be very realistic with cowry shells and 3D pieces. Bring your traditional Barjees experience digitally to your iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. You can play Barjees in a single player game against the AI or challenge a friend in a two player game.
